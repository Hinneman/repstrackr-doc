# Accessibility Features

We are committed to making our app accessible to everyone. Here is an overview of the accessibility features available in our application.

## VoiceOver Support
Our app is fully compatible with VoiceOver. We have carefully labeled all interactive elements, buttons, and images so that screen readers can accurately describe them. This ensures that visually impaired users can effectively navigate and use all the features of the app.

## Voice Control
You can navigate and interact with the app hands-free using Voice Control. All buttons and controls have accessible names, allowing you to trigger them simply by speaking their names.

## Dark Mode
We support a system-wide Dark Mode. If your device is set to Dark Mode, the app will automatically adjust its color scheme to reduce eye strain in low-light environments. The text and background colors are optimized for readability.

## Larger Text (Scientific Type)
The app respects your device's text size settings. If you have enabled larger text in your system settings, the app's text will scale up accordingly, making it easier to read without breaking the layout.

## High Contrast Mode
We have designed the app with high contrast in mind to ensure content is distinguishable. We aim to meet or exceed WCAG AA standards for contrast ratios, making text stand out clearly against background colors.

You can further enhance the contrast by enabling the "High Contrast" setting in the app's settings.

## Large Touch Targets
We have ensured that all interactive elements, such as buttons and icons, have large enough touch targets (minimum 48x48dp). This makes it easier to tap the correct element, even for users with limited motor control.

## Accessibility Hints and Labels
Beyond just names, we provide helpful hints for buttons and controls. These hints explain what a button does (e.g., "Starts the workout") rather than just what it is, giving you more context and confidence when interacting with the app.
